* **[You can pass data of one module to another by using functions](html-processing.md#working-with-modules-and-data-handlebars). So, it is really easy to init module with any data.**
* Great refactoring. 
    - Add ES6, all tasks refactoring.
    - Build process starts much more fast. All dependencies are required only at that moment then they are really needed.
    - Some methods and helpers have been added:
        + skipTaskLog method — add info about skipped tasks into gulp log;
        + skipTaskWithEmptyPipe helper — it allows you to skip task, if no files were passed through that task;
        + root property — you can get absolute path to tars folder from this property.
        + isDevMode property — it returns !tars.flags.release && !tars.flags.min
    - There are only links to tasks in gulpfile. All main tasks (like build, dev) have been moved from gulpfile to tasks/main and to watchers.
    - Task browsersync has been removed. Browsersync starts in main:dev task.
    - Tasks svg-action and compile-html-with-data-reloading have been moved to watchers.
    - Task minify-html has been renamed to modify-html.
    - Task pre-build has been renamed and moved into namespace main (main:pre-build).
* [You can use css-files, that won't be compiled to one file](css-processing.md).
* All js-code from static folder is in ignore section in babelrc by default. Babel has been updated to version 6.
* Page template and head module update. All useless attributes has been removed. Template looks like page in [html5boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate).
* You can use %=static=% or \_\_static\_\_ in CSS and HTML instead of %=staticPrefixForCss=% and %=staticPrefix=%. Old prefixes are supported, but it is strongly recommended to use new prefixes.
* staticPrefixForCss property has been removed from tars-config and it is generated in tars/tars.js automatically.
* Normalize has been updated to version 3.0.3
* **[You can use custom Jade and Handlebars helpers](html-processing.md).**
* Helper icon for Jade and Handlebars has been added to TARS. This helper generates template for svg-symbol including.
* You can use [svg-symbols](svg-processing.md#svg-symbols). TARS supports three ways to include svg-symbols. Build for IE8 not supported in that workflow. And there is a polyfill in separate-js for svg-symbols correct loading for IE9 - Edge and all browsers, which don't support with flow.
* useSVG property has been removed from tars-config. You have to configure SVG workflow by [new property in config](options.md#svg). In case of using old config (that has useSVG property), SVG config-object will be generated automatically.
* [Data about all used pages will be add to full-data of your project](html-processing.md#html).
* All sprite will have hash in their names then flag `--release` is used.
* You can set port for Browsersync by using [env var](options.md#open).
* [Default autoprefixer config has been updated](options.md#autoprefixerconfig).
* Path to static folder generates automatically and depends on pages fs.
* All useless tags, labels will be removed from build automatically. For example, if you don't build with `--ie` or `--ie8` flag, html5shiv won't be copied to ready build.
* hml5shiv-print has been removed.
* You can use plane JavaScript-object in data files.
* [You can init your project without templater and preprocessor files mutation](https://github.com/tars/tars-cli/blob/master/docs/en/commands.md#tars-init). It would be useful for forks.
* [You can automatically update your project with TARS-CLI](https://github.com/tars/tars-cli/blob/master/docs/en/commands.md#tars-update-project).
* Task re-init is depricated now. This command will be removed from TARS in new version, cause there is great chance to broke your project.
* Documentation update.
