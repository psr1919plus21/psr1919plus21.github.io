# Watchers

As tasks, watchers is a [commonJS-module](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1). All watchers is automatically included in a gulpfile.

You could create your own watcher in a user-watchers directory. By default, there is already an example of watcher. Let's take a closer look.

By default, each watcher requires a set of npm-modules and configs to work correctly:

```javascript
const gulp = tars.packages.gulp;
const gutil = tars.packages.gutil;
const chokidar = tars.packages.chokidar;
const watcherLog = tars.helpers.watcherLog;
```

```javascript
    return chokidar.watch(
        /* String of path pattern or array of strings */,
        Object.assign(tars.options.watch, {
            // Options set bellow will override default from tars.options.watch
            // If you need default options, you can use just tars.options.watch
            ignored: /* String of path pattern or array of strings to ignore. If nothing to igonre — just set it to ''*/,
            persistent: /* Boolean, true by default*/,
            ignoreInitial: /* Boolean, true by default*/
        })
    ).on('all', function(event, path) {
        watcherLog(event, path);
        // You could start as many tasks as you need
        gulp.start(/* Task name (String) to start */);
    });
```

You can pass a pattern or pattern arrays of path to files for which you need to watch into `chokidar.watch`.

You can pass options for chokidar after patterns. If default options are ok for you, you can pass just tars.options.watch as the second argument of chokidar.watch If you need to override some options, you have to use [Object.assign](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign).

You can pass a pattern or pattern arrays of path to files that you want to filter from watching within current watcher into option `ignored`.

In gulp.start task name is passed to be started when following by watchers files were changed. By default watchers work for all file operations (delete, create, rename). You can change this behavior by changing the .on('all', function(event, path) to the needed event. List of available events is in [chokidar docs](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar#getting-started).
